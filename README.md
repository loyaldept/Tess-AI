# Tess AI by @Tesseract Laboratories

Tess AI is the most advanced LLM model designed for complex statistical analysis, computations, and data analytics. It assists with any task, anywhere in the world, and is accessible to everyone. Registration is free.

The Tesseract Team has conducted extensive research in LLM training and model development, with over three major studies dedicated to advancing this technology.

Tess AI draws inspiration from the groundbreaking works of Geoffrey Hinton, Ilya Sutskever, and DeepSeek-AI, and is proudly developed by @Tesseract Laboratories.
